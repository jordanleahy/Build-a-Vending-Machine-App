 Helpful Notes
 - Deciding on Object Type: Value types such as a struct or enum are things.  Reference types or classes do things.
 - Classes are good at modeling state, the particular values in our data model at a point in time.
 - In Swift, there is no nice way to ask an enum for how many members and what those members are
 - if a variable in a protocol is read only, change it to a constant in the conforming object
 - Whenever you implement an initializer that is defined as a protocol requirement, you have to put the required keyword.
 - Property List: Organizes data into named values and lists of values.
 - Hard coding the means to obtain data inside the class that uses the data is the wrong approach
 - An instance method is a method that is called on an instance of a particular type
 - A type method is associated with the type itself.  You add static, if it is a struct or class before the method name.
 - NSDictionary has a initializer method, Contents of File that takes a string, containing a path to a file. It then returns a fully initialized dictionary instance with the contents of that file.
 - An array can only contain a single type.
 - This is operator returns true if the type matches a type we specify and false if not. It can check on subclass types if an instance is of the base class
 - NSDictionary in Swift is more specifically represented as NSObject to AnyObject.  NSObject is an Objective C tyoe that is the base class for every object in the language
 - AnyObject represents any class in Swift
 - static keyword before func is used to indicate a type method.  Type Methods are called on the actual type, in and of itself.
 - AnyObject represents a class type
 - Retrieving a value from a dictionary using a key always returns an optional because that key may not exist.
 - Once you assign a rawValue to an enum, it also gets an initializer method that allows you to pass in a rawValue and returns and enum case

 when a user selects an item, we need to make sure it is a valid one, then check if it is in stock, then make sure they have enough cash to buy. These are all cases where an error can occor
